### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ivan KaliniÄ‡, fifth year student of Software Engineering and Information Systems at FER. I am very curios and motivated about web development so I'm learning new stuff every day. My favorite area of web development is Frontend, especially React with the help from TypeScript. You can check out some of my projects on my repositories page and here is also my LinkedIn profile to see my working experience https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivan-kalini%C4%87-a6203a203/. I'm also looking to get familiar with other frameworks or topics related to Frontend development.
